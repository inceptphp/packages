Pages and article post integration as well as functions to make the platform act like a content management platform

## Install

If you already installed Incept, you may not need to install this because it
should be already included.

```bash
$ bin/incept inceptphp/packages/website install
$ bin/incept inceptphp/packages/website populate
```
